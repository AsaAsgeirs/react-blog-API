## React blog - Rest API

I followed a tutorial on how to create a full-stack app using React, Node.js and MongoDB.
In the end I created a open blog application where users can create post, edit, delete and read blogs.

> Disclaimer: Vercel won't let the images show, but you can see the back-end works. I didn't have time to put some images manually just for the look in VScode, will come later.
